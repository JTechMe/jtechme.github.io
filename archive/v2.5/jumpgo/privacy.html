            <h3>JumpGo Browser Pricacy Policy</h3>
				<p>
                We view your privacy with the upmost importance. This document explains how we take care of your privacy when using the JumpGo browser.
				</p>
				<p>
				This document contains the privacy policy for multiple editions of JumpGo. Jump to <a href="#Windows">JumpGo for Windows</a>. Jump to <a href="#Android">JumpGo for Android</a>.
				</p>
				<h4>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h4>
				<p>
				For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.
				</p>
				<p>
				Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

				<h3>JumpGo for Windows</h3>
				<p>
				The Windows version of JumpGo
				</p>
				<h4>How do we learn information about you?</h4>
				<p>
				We learn information about you when:
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to contact us);</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>How do we use your personal information?</h4>
				<p>
				When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission (e.g., responding to feedback you've provided).
				</p>
				<h4>When do we share your information with others?</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>
				<li>When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h4>
				<p>
				We take steps to ensure your personal information is safe once we have it. We do not keep your personal information stored in public locations (e.g., online library refferences, public forums) unless authorized by you.
				</p>
				<p>
				We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.
